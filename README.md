MIDI Workshop
==============
The Musical Instrument Digital Interface is now thirty (30) years old.
As someone who has interfaced musical instruments for over thirty (30) years
I have some interesting perspectives and stories around MIDI and the musical instrument industry.
This Workshop will cover the history and theory of controlling musical instruments, followed
by some Hand's On labs where we'll interface and control MIDI devices.
